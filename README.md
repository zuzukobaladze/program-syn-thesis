## 📄 Abstract

*Program synthesis*, the automated generation of executable code from high-level specifications, has long stood as a central goal in computer science. This thesis presents a comparative literature review of the five major paradigms:

- Logic-Based (Deductive) Synthesis  
- Inductive (Example-Based) Synthesis  
- Sketch & Schema-Based Synthesis  
- LLM-Based Synthesis  
- Neuro-Symbolic (Hybrid) Synthesis  

The review outlines each paradigm’s motivations, mechanisms, systems, and trade-offs—ultimately showcasing the transition from formal methods to statistical models.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Understanding how programs can be automatically generated — from **formal logic** or **natural language** — is essential to the future of software engineering.

This thesis offers a comprehensive roadmap of where the field of **program synthesis** has been, and where it's headed next.
